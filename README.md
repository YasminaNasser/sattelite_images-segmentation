# Satellite Image Segmentation 

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting water bodies from satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. It aims to assist in environmental monitoring, water resource management, and geographic analysis by accurately identifying water-covered areas from high-resolution satellite images.

## Features

- **Automatic Segmentation** – Detects and outlines water bodies in satellite imagery.  
- **Deep Learning Based** – Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-level classification.  
- **Custom Dataset Support** – Works with various satellite imagery sources and resolutions.  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Includes normalization, augmentation, and resizing of input data.  
- **Postprocessing** – Refines segmentation masks to reduce noise and improve boundary accuracy.  
- **Visualization Tools** – Generates color-coded segmentation overlays for easy interpretation.  

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras / PyTorch  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset Sources:** Sentinel-2, Landsat, or custom satellite imagery
